The repository intends to showcase my experience in working with python programming language. The works are the very basic codes I wrote as part of the introductory course I attended. Further I have also explored python libraries like MDAnalysis, MDTraj, OpenMM, PLUMED as part of my internship role at IIIT Hyderabad.
